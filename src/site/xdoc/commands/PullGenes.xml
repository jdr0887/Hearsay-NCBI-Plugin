      <subsection name="Source">
	<p>This command uses the following file as the source for a
	list of Gene instances:</p>
	<source>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz</source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Threading &amp; Synchronization">
	<p>This command assumes that Gene instances may already exist.
	Therefore, it is written to check for the existence of a Gene
	by symbol before persisting a new instance.  And since the
	command checks for the existence of previously persisted Gene
	instances, multithreading is not used....avoiding race
	conditions.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Filtering">
	<p>If the chromosome is '-' or 'Un', the gene will be ignored.</p>
