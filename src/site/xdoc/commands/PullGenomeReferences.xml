	<p>This command uses the following file as the source for a
	list of Genome Reference instances:</p>
	<source>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/assembly_summary_refseq.txt</source>

      <subsection name="Threading &amp; Synchronization">
	<p>This command assumes that GenomeReference instances may
	already exist.  Therefore, it is written to check for the
	existence of a GenomeReference by symbol before persisting a
	new instance.  And since the command checks for the existence
	of previously persisted GenomeReference instances,
	multithreading is not used....avoiding race conditions.</p>
